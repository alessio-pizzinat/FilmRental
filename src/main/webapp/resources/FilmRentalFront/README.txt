HERE YOU HAVE TO DO:

ng init

For now this part is on hold waiting for angular2 to mature and give us better support in designing the front-end part of our application.
In particular the frist focus for whomever wants to continue should be understanding how to map JSONs into Typescrip objects.

Even if quite young Angular2 is clearly a powerful tool to shape the frontend and it was quite interesting to work with.

Happy coding,
